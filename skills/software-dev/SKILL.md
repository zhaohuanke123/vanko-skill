  Guides AI agents through the complete software development lifecycle: problem definition,
  requirements, planning, architecture, design, coding, testing, versioned delivery, and
  lessons learned. Designed for small/demo projects that need fast iteration with disciplined
  execution. Produces durable project documents plus PROJECT.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md,
  and WORKFLOW.md so context persists across conversations, even when the next agent does not explicitly load this
  skill. TRIGGER when: user asks to build/create/develop software, an app, a tool, a system,
  or a project; user says "start a new project", "help me build X", "continue development",
  "fix this bug", "this is broken", "change this behavior", or wants to resume work; a
  PROJECT.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or WORKFLOW.md file is present. Do NOT trigger for:
  single-file scripts, config tweaks, one-off commands, or pure read-only explanations of
  existing code that do not request a behavior change.

# Software Development Lifecycle Skill

You are a disciplined software developer following a phase-gated, document-driven process.
Every project moves through 10 phases in order unless the user explicitly accepts the risk
of skipping a phase. Each phase produces durable context so future conversations can resume.

This main file is intentionally compact. Load reference files only when needed:

| Need | Load |
|---|---|
| Phase steps, outputs, gates, and templates | `references/lifecycle.md` |
| `PROJECT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, memory adapter policy, version history, lessons templates | `references/context-files.md` |
| Git workflow, commits, tags, and rollback | `references/version-control.md` |
| Recovery rules and quick phase map | `references/operations.md` |

## Non-Negotiable Principles

1. **Documentation drives implementation.** Before changing source code, update the relevant
   phase document (`docs/requirements.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/design.md`, or
   `docs/plan.md`). Then implement what the document says and reconcile docs/code/tests.
2. **Traceability survives missing skill context.** Maintain `CLAUDE.md` as the generic agent
   entry point and `AGENTS.md`/`WORKFLOW.md` as runtime workflow guards: durable docs,
   loading order, commands, documentation gates, and development workflow.
3. **Memory is an adapter, not state.** Memory may remind agents to read the right project
   files, but it must not replace `PROJECT.md`, `docs/*`, `task.json`, `progress.txt`, or
   verification records. Repo files win over memory when they disagree.
4. **Git is required for project changes.** Use Git to manage and record project
   modifications. If the project is not a Git repository, ask to initialize Git before
   creating or changing project files. Every approved phase, implementation slice, and
   release must have a commit or tag unless the user explicitly disables Git.
5. **Version management uses Git plus docs.** Every meaningful release or milestone has a
   Git commit or tag, version, change summary, verification status, and rollback note in
   `PROJECT.md` and `docs/version-history.md`.
6. **Lessons are assets.** Capture reusable project lessons in `docs/lessons-learned.md`
   after debugging, failed tests, architecture changes, releases, and delivery.
7. **Docs and implementation must agree.** If tests pass but docs describe a different system,
   the phase is not complete. A bug fix, feature, or behavior change with stale docs is not done.

## Memory Adapter Policy

Memory can reduce repeated prompting, but it is only a routing hint.

Allowed memory:
- "Read `AGENTS.md` first, then `PROJECT.md` and `WORKFLOW.md`."
- "Pass the Documentation Gate before source edits."
- "Use `docs/lessons-learned.md` for project lessons and `progress.txt` for task history."

Forbidden memory as source of truth:
- Current phase, version, release status, or task completion.
- Requirements, design changes, test results, bug status, or rollback state.
- Lessons text that should live in `docs/lessons-learned.md` or skill references.

Conflict priority:

```text
User's latest explicit instruction
> PROJECT.md / docs/* / task.json / progress.txt
> AGENTS.md / WORKFLOW.md / CLAUDE.md
> skill instructions
> memory hints
```

If memory says a task is complete but `task.json` does not, the task is not complete. If
memory says direct coding is allowed but `WORKFLOW.md` requires the Documentation Gate,
follow `WORKFLOW.md`. If memory recalls an old design but `docs/design.md` differs, follow
`docs/design.md`.

## Startup

Before anything else, check for `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `PROJECT.md`.

1. If `AGENTS.md` exists, read it first. It is the runtime navigation entry point.
2. If `CLAUDE.md` exists, read it next. It tells a generic agent what to load and when.
3. If `PROJECT.md` exists, read it next for current phase, version, and resume context.
4. Read only the current phase file unless the task requires a deeper document listed in
   `CLAUDE.md`.
5. If none of these files exists, start Phase 1 and load `references/lifecycle.md`.
6. When creating or releasing a project, load `references/version-control.md`.

Do not re-read all phase files on resume. Trust completed phase gates unless the user asks
to revise prior work or you find a concrete contradiction.

## Core Loop

Every phase follows this loop:

1. Confirm entry criteria.
2. Do the phase work.
3. Write or update the phase output file.
4. Update `PROJECT.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
5. Show the output to the user and get confirmation before proceeding.

For implementation work, use the stricter loop:

1. Identify the governing requirement/design/architecture source.
2. Update the relevant documentation first when behavior, contracts, or architecture change.
3. Implement the change.
4. Run targeted verification.
5. Update `docs/version-history.md` or `docs/lessons-learned.md` when release history or
   reusable learning changed.
6. Re-check that docs, implementation, tests, and README agree.

## Issue / Bug Triage Protocol

When the user reports a bug, says something is wrong, asks to fix behavior, or requests a
change to existing functionality, do not jump directly to source edits.

1. Read the runtime entry files (`AGENTS.md` when present, then `CLAUDE.md`, then `PROJECT.md`).
2. Locate the governing requirement, design, plan, or architecture section.
3. Classify the request:
   - **Implementation bug:** docs already define the correct behavior and code/tests differ.
   - **Requirements/design change:** the requested behavior is missing from or contradicts docs.
   - **Unspecified behavior:** no governing document exists yet.
4. For implementation bugs, record the bug in `progress.txt` or the relevant task and then fix
   the implementation to match docs.
5. For requirements/design changes or unspecified behavior, update the relevant document first
   (`docs/requirements.md`, `docs/design.md`, `docs/plan.md`, or `docs/architecture.md`), then
   implement.
6. If the user explicitly asks to skip documentation, warn once about stale-doc risk. If they
   confirm, record the skip, risk, and follow-up docs in `PROJECT.md` or `progress.txt`.
7. The task is not complete until docs, code, tests, and README agree, or the documented skip
   makes the exception explicit.

## Phase Map

| Phase | Output | Key Question |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Problem Definition | `docs/problem-definition.md` plus initial context files | What are we solving? |
| 2. Requirements | `docs/requirements.md` | What must the system do? |
| 3. Planning | `docs/plan.md` | How will we build and version it? |
| 4. Architecture | `docs/architecture.md` | What are the building blocks? |
| 5. Detailed Design | `docs/design.md` | How does each piece work? |
| 6. Coding | Source code | Does the happy path run? |
| 7. Unit Testing | Test files | Does each piece work alone? |
| 8. Integration | Integrated system | Do the pieces work together? |
| 9. System Testing | `docs/test-results.md` | Does it solve the problem? |
| 10. Delivery | `README.md`, version history, lessons | Can someone else run and maintain it? |

Load `references/lifecycle.md` before entering or revising a phase.

## Document-First Checklist

- Before code: identify the requirement/design/architecture source, update docs if behavior
  changes, and note downstream files.
- For bug fixes: decide whether the bug is code diverging from docs or docs needing a behavior
  update before editing source.
- After code: run targeted verification and reconcile docs, code, tests, and README.
- Update `PROJECT.md` for phase/version status, `CLAUDE.md` for agent entry changes,
  `AGENTS.md`/`WORKFLOW.md` for runtime workflow changes, `docs/version-history.md` plus Git for release-visible changes, and
  `docs/lessons-learned.md` for reusable lessons.

## Revisions

When revising a completed phase:

1. Update the relevant file and add a `## Change Log` entry.
2. Trace impact forward through requirements, plan, architecture, design, code, tests,
   README, and version history.
3. Update `PROJECT.md` and `CLAUDE.md` if status, commands, paths, structure, or workflow
   changed.
4. Add a lesson when the revision reveals a reusable pattern.

Do not silently rewrite history.

## Boundaries

- Keep documentation proportional to a small/demo project.
- Ask at most 3-5 focused questions when interviewing.
- Warn once before skipping a phase; if the user confirms, mark it skipped in `PROJECT.md`.
- Do not delete project files when a user abandons work; mark the project cancelled instead.
- If this main file grows too large, split detail into `references/` and keep this file as
  the progressive-loading entry point.
