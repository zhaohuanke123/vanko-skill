# Vanko Skill

A Claude Code skills marketplace containing personal AI development utilities.

## Available Skills

### task-driven-ai-dev

Turn a repository into a task-driven AI delivery loop with durable planning artifacts, guarded single-task execution, progress logging, and validation gates.

**Features:**
- **Architecture Documentation**: Maintain system overview, constraints, and integration boundaries
- **Task Management**: Track backlog with dependencies, blocked state, and validation notes
- **Progress Logging**: Dated execution log with testing evidence
- **Project Configuration**: Repo-specific commands and artifact paths
- **Git Integration**: Automatic commit after task completion

### coding-workflow

A structured development workflow for fullstack projects with documentation gates, verification gates, persistent state, and browser testing integration.

**Features:**
- **Task Selection**: Automatically select next incomplete task from task.json
- **Documentation Gate**: Require task-level requirement/design references before implementation
- **Memory Adapter Rule**: Treat memory as a routing hint; repo files remain the source of truth
- **Implementation Guidance**: Follow existing docs, code patterns, and conventions
- **Testing Gates**: Lint, build, browser testing, and docs/code/tests consistency checks
- **Progress Documentation**: Persistent session history, documentation updates, and skip-risk records in progress.txt
- **Blocking Protocol**: Clear handling of tasks that require human intervention
- **Rollback Support**: Clean recovery from failed implementations

### interactive-learning

Interactive learning system based on Bloom's "2 Sigma Problem" and mastery learning principles.

**Features:**
- **Dialog-Based Verification**: AI generates questions dynamically, asks follow-up questions to verify understanding
- **Mastery Learning**: Only proceed when truly understanding (L3 application level)
- **Branch Exploration**: Dive deep into concepts that interest you, return to main path anytime
- **Progress Tracking**: Resume learning across conversations, never lose context
- **Feynman Method**: Learn by explaining, AI helps you find knowledge gaps
- **Error Correction**: Correct AI mistakes, make learning a collaborative process
- **Source Citations**: Generate courses based on your documents, books, or websites with proper citations
- **Obsidian Integration**: Auto-add `^block-id` for precise note references
- **Spaced Repetition**: Ebbinghaus forgetting curve review system (20min, 1h, 1d, 2d, 6d, 31d)

### software-dev

Guides AI agents through the complete software development lifecycle with phase-gated, document-driven execution. Designed for small/demo projects that need fast iteration with disciplined delivery.

**Features:**
- **10-Phase Lifecycle**: Problem definition → requirements → planning → architecture → design → coding → unit testing → integration → system testing → delivery
- **Document-First**: Update documentation before implementation; bug fixes and behavior changes must pass a documentation gate; docs, code, and tests must agree
- **Progressive Loading**: Compact main file with reference files loaded on demand
- **Cross-Conversation Persistence**: `PROJECT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `WORKFLOW.md` preserve context and runtime workflow across sessions
- **Memory Adapter Policy**: Memory may remind agents where to start, but cannot replace project state or docs
- **Git Integration**: Commits, tags, and rollback built into every phase
- **Recovery Protocol**: Exception handling for missing files, dirty worktrees, and abandoned projects
