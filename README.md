## Available Skills

### task-driven-ai-dev

Turn a repository into a task-driven AI delivery loop with durable planning artifacts, guarded single-task execution, progress logging, and validation gates.

**Features:**
- **Architecture Documentation**: Maintain system overview, constraints, and integration boundaries
- **Task Management**: Track backlog with dependencies, blocked state, and validation notes
- **Progress Logging**: Dated execution log with testing evidence
- **Project Configuration**: Repo-specific commands and artifact paths
- **Git Integration**: Automatic commit after task completion

### coding-workflow

A structured development workflow for fullstack projects with verification gates, persistent state, and browser testing integration.

**Features:**
- **Task Selection**: Automatically select next incomplete task from task.json
- **Implementation Guidance**: Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- **Testing Gates**: Lint, build, and browser testing with MCP Playwright
- **Progress Documentation**: Persistent session history in progress.txt
- **Blocking Protocol**: Clear handling of tasks that require human intervention
- **Rollback Support**: Clean recovery from failed implementations

### interactive-learning

Interactive learning system based on Bloom's "2 Sigma Problem" and mastery learning principles.

**Features:**
- **Dialog-Based Verification**: AI generates questions dynamically, asks follow-up questions to verify understanding
- **Mastery Learning**: Only proceed when truly understanding (L3 application level)
- **Branch Exploration**: Dive deep into concepts that interest you, return to main path anytime
- **Progress Tracking**: Resume learning across conversations, never lose context
- **Feynman Method**: Learn by explaining, AI helps you find knowledge gaps
- **Error Correction**: Correct AI mistakes, make learning a collaborative process
- **Source Citations**: Generate courses based on your documents, books, or websites with proper citations
- **Obsidian Integration**: Auto-add `^block-id` for precise note references
